# UTD-CS-SE-Assignments

In this repository I have included all coding assignments and projects I have written in my time attending the University of Texas at Dallas, studying for my Computer Science and Software Engineering double major.

Each course directory will have its own README explaining the course and the assignments contained within.

The code in this repository is not the best representative of my capabilities, merely proof of what I have done studying at UTD.

My best projects are displayed on my personal webpage: http://rahatah.me/d
