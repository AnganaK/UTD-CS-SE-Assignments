# CS 3345 - Data Structures and Introduction to Algorithmic Analysis

## Course Description

Analysis of algorithms including time complexity and Big-O notation. Analysis of stacks, queues, and trees, including B-trees. Heaps, hashing, and advanced sorting techniques. Disjoint sets and graphs. Course emphasizes design and implementation.

## Project 1

This simple assignment familiarized us with using Generics in Java.

## Project 2

This assignment had us implement a generic linked list in Java.

## Project 3

This assignment had us implement a generic binary search tree in Java.

## Project 4

This assignment had us implement a spell checker, indexing words in a quadratic probing hash table.
