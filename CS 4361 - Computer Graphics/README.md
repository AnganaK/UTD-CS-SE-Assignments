# CS 4361 - Computer Graphics

## Course Description

Review of graphic display architecture and graphic input devices. Two- and three-dimensional transformations, matrix formulations, and concatenation. Clipping and windowing. Data structures for graphics systems, segmented display files, rings, etc. Hidden line and surface elimination. Shading. Graphics packages and applications. 

## Hexagon.java

Draws a grid of hexagons that fits in the window. Hexagon radius specified by clicking a distance from the top left corner. Run with `javac Hexagon.java && java Hexagon`.

## ConcentricSquares.java

Draws the largest set of concentric squares that will fit in the window. Run with `javac ConcentricSquares.java && java ConcentricSquares`.

## DashedLine.java

Defines a function that draws a dashed line. Run with `javac DashedLine.java && java DashedLine`.

## ArbitrarySquare.java

Draws an arbitrary square ABCD defined by clicking on two points to define a side AB. Run with `javac ArbitrarySquare.java && java ArbitrarySquare`.

## SuperPixels.java

Demonstrates how drawLine and drawCircle methods by drawing with "super pixels". Lines and circle are specified in `input.txt`. Run with `javac SuperPixels.java && java SuperPixels`.

## ClipPoly.java

Clips polygon with a rectangle. Draws old polygon with dotted lines, and fills clipped polygon with blue. Run with `javac ClipPoly.java && java ClipPoly`.

## rahat_ahmed.java (Tree of Pythagoras)

*Don't ask why it's called rahat_ahmed.java, that was our professor's requirement.* Draws a tree of pythagoras from user defined points (click Pythagoras in menu, then click to define square). Run with `javac rahat_ahmed.java && java rahat_ahmed`.

## assignment5

Draws a colored polygon while continuously rotating. See README.txt.

## curves.java

Modification of a program that draws iterations of L-system fractal grammars. Modified to draw curved 90 degree corners to better illustrate Dragon curve. Run with `javac curves.java && java curves Dragon.txt`.
