## ECS Design Project

Our final project was to build a nerf dart shooter that will shoot any passersby who do not have an authentication card. We built this on the Arduino platform. Included is the presentation of our project, and the code for the Arduino board. NOTE: Most of the code is vendor provided code for using the RFID reader, my code is located around the beginning of the loop() function.
