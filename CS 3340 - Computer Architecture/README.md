# CS 3340 - Computer Architecture

## Course Description

This course introduces the concepts of computer architecture by going through multiple levels of abstraction, and the numbering systems and their basic computations. It focuses on the instruction-set architecture of the MIPS machine, including MIPS assembly programming, translation between MIPS and C, and between MIPS and machine code. General topics include performance calculation, processor datapath, pipelining, and memory hierarchy.

## Homework 3

In this simple assignment I wrote a MIPS assembly program that asks for two numbers and outputs the sum, product, and quotient/remainder of the two numbers.

## Final Project

Our final group project was to write a MIPS assembly program that would parse a song in MIDI file format and play it back. This was significantly difficult because of the age of the MIDI file format, and the scarcity of good documentation on the format. Still, we managed to write a program that played the song back with only a few hiccups. I wrote a majority of the parsing functionality and some of the playback functionality. (To run it you must use the provided MARS4midi.jar MIPS emulator. There is a bug in the original involving MIDI playback that is fixed in this version.)
