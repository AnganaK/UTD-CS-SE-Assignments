# CS 3376 - C C++ Programming in a UNIX Environment

## Course Description

Advanced programming techniques utilizing procedural and object oriented programming in a UNIX environment. Topics include file input and output, implementation of strings, stacks, queues, lists, and trees, and dynamic memory allocation/management. Design and implementation of a comprehensive programming project is required.

## Assignment 1

The assignment was to write a couple simple guessing games, one where the user guesses the computer's number, and another where the computer guesses the user's number.

## Assignment 2

The assignment was to create a theater seat assignment program. The purpose of this was to illustrate basic understanding of dynamic memory allocation.

## Project 3

The assignment was to write a program to simulate a restaurant. The assignment had strict requirements for functionality, and thoroughly exercised our ability to manage objects and memory allocation without causing memory leaks.

## Assignment 4

I cannot recall exactly what this assignment was, but I believe it was given to have us practice using templates in C++.

## Project 5

The assignment was to write an expression evaluator program that used pipes to perform operations with separate programs.
