## Course Description

Methods and principles of human-computer interaction (HCI), user-centered design (UCD), and usability evaluation. Provides broad overview of HCI and how HCI informs UCD processes throughout product development lifecycle.

## Final Class Prototype

The main project of this course had us design and implement a web application to help research experimenters manage their experiments and participants. There were a total of 5 prototypes, each one iterating on the previous one and adding new functionality. In this folder I have included the source for the final prototype. Since it's slightly annoying to set up hosting this, I have it up on my host: http://rahatah.me/wordpress/

**BAD CODE WARNING:** My god is the code I wrote here atrocious. In the interest of implementing the prototypes in time, I had to sacrifice all best practices (plus I didn't really know PHP much at the time). This project is absolutely not a good indicator of the kind of code I usually write.
